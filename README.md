#Elemental Archive

Elemental Archive is a python program written in VS Code. It is based on a personal project of mine where I am creating dragons based on the elements of the periodic table. The features each dragon has is determined by the corresponding element's coordinates on the periodic table. This required manual cross-referencing of information detrimined by both the element's group (x axis) and its period (y axis). My goal with this project is to make an archive, retreiving information from these coordinates to print out the features of an element when requested.
